# 🤖 HG Bot Intelligence  
### Autonomous Multi-Agent AI System  
HG Bot Intelligence is a powerful, fully autonomous multi-agent AI system built to solve complex tasks, generate content, research information, and assist users through intelligent decision-making. It uses multiple coordinated AI agents that work together like a miniature digital workforce.

## 🚀 Features  
### 🧠 Multi-Agent Architecture  
HG Bot uses several specialized AI agents, each with a unique role, such as:  
- **Research Agent** – analyzes topics, gathers data, forms insights  
- **Creative Agent** – writes content, brainstorms ideas, generates text  
- **Logic Agent** – solves problems, plans steps, and performs reasoning  
- **Assistant Agent** – handles conversations and user interaction  

All agents collaborate to produce high-quality results.
